# The Comprehensive Guide to Graduate School

## Introduction

Welcome to graduate school at UofT's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics! We (the current graduate students) have written this guide to try and help you through all of the administrative details so you can get straight to your research. If you like, you can skip ahead to our suggested [to-do list](#new-student-to-do-list) for new students, or use the table of contents on the left to navigate to the appropriate section (note that the table of contents is not currently available on small screens).

This is a living document, you can contribute to its creation by forking the [uoftgasa](https://github.com/uoftgasa/uoftgasa.github.io) repository.

## Important Dates

There's a lot that goes on at the beginning of the semester. UofT's Faculty of Arts and Science (of which this Department is a member), maintains an exhaustive list of the [sessional dates](https://fas.calendar.utoronto.ca/sessional-dates), but these are primarily undergraduate focused.

## Units

The Astronomy and Astrophysics community at UofT is composed of several units: the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the Dunlap Institute, the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, and the Centre for Planetary Sciences. The relationships between these bodies can be a bit complex, but each unit is a part of the overall fabric of the department.

### Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics
[Website](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca)

All astronomy graduate students at UofT are officially affiliated with the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics (DAA), primarily spread across two buildings, the [Astronomy Building](#astronomy-building) and the 12th, 13th and 14th floors of the [Burton Tower attached to McLennan Physical Labs](#mclennan-physical-labs-and-burton-tower). 

### Dunlap Institute

[Website](http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca)

The Dunlap Institute (Dunlap) is primarily focused on advancing instrumentation-based research and improving scientific outreach. Dunlap members (professors and post-docs) are located in the [Astronomy Building](#astronomy-building). Graduate students can become affiliated with the Dunlap if they are supervised by a Dunlap professor. These students can apply for additional funding not available to the rest of their cohort and are invited to Dunlap specific events like holiday parties and the 3 day Dunlap Retreat.

### Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics

[Website](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca)

The Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) focuses on theoretical work CITA is located on the 13th and 14th floors of the [Burton Tower attached to McLennan Physical Labs](#mclennan-physical-labs-and-burton-tower).

### Centre for Planetary Sciences
[Website](https://cps.utoronto.ca)

The Centre for Planetary Sciences (CPS) is located on UofT's [Scarborough campus](#scarborough). Most offices are on the 5th floor of the Science Wing.
