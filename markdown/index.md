# The Comprehensive Guide to Graduate School

## Introduction

Welcome to graduate school at UofT's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics! We (the current graduate students) have written this guide to try and help you through all of the administrative details so you can get straight to your research. If you like, you can skip ahead to our suggested [to-do list](todo.html) for new students, or use the table of contents on the left to navigate to the appropriate section (note that the table of contents is not currently available on small screens).

This is a living document, you can contribute to its creation by forking the [uoftgasa](https://github.com/uoftgasa/uoftgasa.github.io) repository.
