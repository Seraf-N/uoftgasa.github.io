<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to graduate school at UofT’s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics! We (the current graduate students) have written this guide to try and help you through all of the administrative details so you can get straight to your research. If you like, you can skip ahead to our suggested <a href="#new-student-to-do-list">to-do list</a> for new students, or use the table of contents on the left to navigate to the appropriate section (note that the table of contents is not currently available on small screens).</p>
<p>This is a living document, you can contribute to its creation by forking the <a href="https://github.com/uoftgasa/uoftgasa.github.io">uoftgasa</a> repository.</p>

<li><strong>UTORid</strong> - your unique online identifier at UofT, given to you when you get your TCard (see the <a href="#to-do">to-do list below</a>).

<h2 id="units">Units</h2>
<p>The Astronomy and Astrophysics community at UofT is composed of several units: the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the Dunlap Institute, the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, and the Centre for Planetary Sciences. The relationships between these bodies can be a bit complex, but each unit is a part of the overall fabric of the department.</p>
<h3 id="department-of-astronomy-and-astrophysics">Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca">Website</a></p>

Graduate students can become affiliated with the Dunlap if they are supervised by a Dunlap professor. These students can apply for additional funding not available to the rest of their cohort and are invited to Dunlap specific events like holiday parties and the 3 day Dunlap Retreat.</p>
<h3 id="canadian-institute-for-theoretical-astrophysics">Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cita.utoronto.ca">Website</a></p>

<h3 id="astronomy-building">Astronomy Building</h3>
<p>Located at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/jdwZv75EraG2">50 St George Street</a>, the Astronomy Building (AB) is a two storey building housing primarily graduate student, post-doc and professor offices, in addition to several basement labs and a couple of undergraduate lecture rooms. The building has two entrances, one from St George St and one from Russell St. Neither entrance is accessible; getting to any room inside this building requires climbing or descending stairs. The St George St doors are locked after 6pm, while the Russell St doors and the internal doors leading to the office sections of the building (which can be opened with your mailroom key) are locked after 9pm.</p>
